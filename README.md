# Automated-Bot
This is a automated PreOrdering Bot made in python using selenium.After the events that occured with the Nvidia RTX 3080 my curiosity peaked and decided to make a script of my own, trying my hand in the technology.

1. The config file is where you enter all relevant shipping and billing information
2. There are two scripts
   - NeweggBot.py
   - BestbuyBot.py
   

# How To Setup

3.  Perform a pip install on the requirments.text
